To create 3D graphics in Java without using any libraries, you will need to use Java's built-in graphics libraries, such as the Java2D and Java3D APIs.

Java2D is a 2D graphics library that is part of the Java Standard Edition (SE). It provides a set of classes for creating and manipulating 2D graphics, such as shapes, text, and images. You can use Java2D to draw 2D graphics on a canvas, and then use 3D transformations to project the 2D graphics onto a 3D plane. This is known as 2D rendering, and it is a common technique used in many 3D games.

Java3D is a 3D graphics library that is also part of the Java SE. It provides a set of classes for creating and manipulating 3D graphics, such as 3D models, 3D transformations, lighting, and shading. You can use Java3D to create 3D graphics directly, without the need to render 2D graphics onto a 3D plane. However, Java3D can be more difficult to use than Java2D, and it requires a deeper understanding of computer graphics concepts.

To create 3D graphics in Java, you will need to have a good understanding of computer graphics concepts such as 3D transformations, lighting, and shading. You will also need to have strong programming skills, as creating 3D graphics from scratch can be a complex task.

To continue creating 3D graphics in Java without using any libraries, you will need to have a good understanding of computer graphics concepts such as 3D transformations, lighting, and shading. Here are a few more things you may want to consider:

1. 3D transformations: 3D transformations allow you to manipulate the position, orientation, and size of 3D objects in your game. This can be done using matrix transformations, which allow you to apply a series of transformations to an object in a single operation.
2. Lighting: Lighting is an important aspect of 3D graphics, as it helps to create the illusion of depth and realism. There are several types of lighting that you can use in your game, such as ambient lighting, diffuse lighting, and specular lighting. You can also use light sources, such as point lights, directional lights, and spotlights, to add more realism to your game.
3. Shading: Shading is the process of applying colors and textures to the surfaces of 3D objects to give them a more realistic appearance. There are several shading techniques that you can use, such as flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong shading. You can also use texture mapping to apply images to the surfaces of your objects.

To create 3D graphics in Java, you will need to use a combination of Java's built-in graphics libraries and your own programming skills. This can be a complex and challenging task, but with persistence and dedication, you can create high-quality 3D graphics for your game.

> tell me more about 3d transformation 
---
3D transformations are used to manipulate the position, orientation, and size of 3D objects in your game. They allow you to translate, rotate, and scale objects in 3D space, and to combine these transformations using matrix math.

In Java, you can use the Java3D API to apply 3D transformations to your objects. The Java3D API provides a class called Transform3D, which represents a 3D transformation as a 4x4 matrix. You can use this class to create translation, rotation, and scaling transformations, and to combine them using matrix multiplication.

Here is an example of how you can use the Transform3D class to translate an object in 3D space:
```java
// Create a translation transformation
Vector3f translation = new Vector3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
Transform3D transform = new Transform3D();
transform.setTranslation(translation);

// Apply the transformation to an object
Object object;
TransformGroup tg = new TransformGroup();
tg.setTransform(transform);
tg.addChild(object);
```
This code creates a translation transformation that moves an object along the X-axis by 1 unit. You can use similar code to create rotation and scaling transformations, or to combine multiple transformations using matrix multiplication.

3D transformations are an important aspect of 3D graphics, and they are used in many different types of games and 3D applications. By understanding how to use 3D transformations in Java, you can create more realistic and interactive 3D objects in your game.

> tell me more about lighting
---
Lighting is an important aspect of 3D graphics, as it helps to create the illusion of depth and realism in your game. There are several types of lighting that you can use in your game, and each type has its own unique properties and effects.

Here are a few common types of lighting that you can use in your game:

1. Ambient lighting: Ambient lighting is a type of global lighting that illuminates all objects in a scene evenly. It is used to create a general level of illumination and to add atmosphere to your game.
2. Diffuse lighting: Diffuse lighting is a type of directional lighting that is reflected evenly in all directions from a surface. It is used to create the illusion of surface texture and to add realism to your game.
3. Specular lighting: Specular lighting is a type of directional lighting that is reflected in a specific direction from a surface. It is used to create the illusion of shiny surfaces and to add realism to your game.
4. Light sources: Light sources are objects that emit light and cast shadows in your game. You can use point lights, directional lights, and spotlights to add more realism to your game.

To use lighting in your game, you will need to use a 3D graphics library such as Java3D or OpenGL. You will also need to have a good understanding of lighting concepts, such as the properties of different light sources and the equations that are used to calculate the intensity of light at different points in a scene.

By using lighting effectively in your game, you can create more realistic and immersive 3D environments for your players.

> tell me more about shading
---
Shading is the process of applying colors and textures to the surfaces of 3D objects to give them a more realistic appearance. There are several shading techniques that you can use in your game, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

Here are a few common shading techniques that you can use in your game:

1. Flat shading: Flat shading is the simplest shading technique, in which each polygon in a 3D model is given a single color. This can give your objects a cartoon-like appearance, but it does not produce very realistic results.
2. Gouraud shading: Gouraud shading is a technique that interpolates the colors of vertices across the surface of a polygon. This can produce more realistic results than flat shading, but it can also introduce visible banding and other artifacts.
3. Phong shading: Phong shading is a technique that interpolates the surface normals of a polygon and calculates the intensity of light at each point on the surface. This can produce very realistic results, but it requires more computational power than other shading techniques.

To use shading in your game, you will need to use a 3D graphics library such as Java3D or OpenGL. You will also need to have a good understanding of shading concepts, such as the properties of different materials and the equations that are used to calculate the intensity of light at different points on a surface.

By using shading effectively in your game, you can create more realistic and immersive 3D environments for your players.

To get started with Java3D, you will need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. Then, you can create a new Java project and add the Java3D library to your classpath.

Here is a simple example of how you can use Java3D to create a 3D cube and add it to a scene:
```java
import javax.media.j3d.*;
import javax.vecmath.*;

// Create a 3D cube
Box cube = new Box(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, appearance);

// Set the position of the cube
Transform3D transform = new Transform3D();
transform.setTranslation(new Vector3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f));
TransformGroup tg = new TransformGroup(transform);
tg.addChild(cube);

// Add the cube to the scene
BranchGroup scene = new BranchGroup();
scene.addChild(tg);

// Create a canvas to display the scene
Canvas3D canvas = new Canvas3D(SimpleUniverse.getPreferredConfiguration());
SimpleUniverse universe = new SimpleUniverse(canvas);
universe.getViewingPlatform().setNominalViewingTransform();
universe.addBranchGraph(scene);
```
This code creates a 3D cube with a default appearance, sets its position using a transformation, and adds it to a scene. It then creates a canvas to display the scene and adds it to a SimpleUniverse, which is a Java3D class that represents a 3D world.

Here are some examples of how you can use Java3D to apply shading to 3D objects:

1. Flat shading: Flat shading applies a single color to the entire surface of a 3D object. You can use the FlatShadeAppearance class to create a flat shading appearance for your 3D object.
```java
FlatShadeAppearance appearance = new FlatShadeAppearance();
appearance.setMaterial(new Material(new Color3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f), 64.0f));
Box box = new Box(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, appearance);
```
2. Gouraud shading: Gouraud shading applies a different color to each vertex of a 3D object, and interpolates the colors across the surface of the object. You can use the GouraudShadeAppearance class to create a Gouraud shading appearance for your 3D object.
```java
GouraudShadeAppearance appearance = new GouraudShadeAppearance();
appearance.setMaterial(new Material(new Color3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f), 64.0f));
Sphere sphere = new Sphere(0.5f, appearance);
```
3. Phong shading: Phong shading applies a different color to each vertex of a 3D object, and interpolates the colors across the surface of the object based on the surface normals. You can use the PhongShadeAppearance class to create a Phong shading appearance for your 3D object.
```java
PhongShadeAppearance appearance = new PhongShadeAppearance();
appearance.setMaterial(new Material(new Color3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f), 64.0f));
Cylinder cylinder = new Cylinder(0.5f, 1.0f, appearance);
```

To continue learning about shading in Java3D, here are some more examples:

5. Texture filters: You can use texture filters to control how textures are displayed on 3D objects. Java3D provides a set of texture filter classes that you can use to apply different effects to your textures, such as mipmapping, anisotropic filtering, and trilinear filtering.
```java
Texture texture = new Texture(image);
texture.setBoundaryModeS(Texture.CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
texture.setBoundaryModeT(Texture.CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
texture.setMinFilter(Texture.MIPMAP_LINEAR);
texture.setMagFilter(Texture.LINEAR);
```
6. Wrapping modes: You can use wrapping modes to control how textures are repeated on 3D objects. Java3D provides a set of wrapping mode constants that you can use to specify how textures are repeated along the S and T dimensions.
```java
Texture texture = new Texture(image);
texture.setBoundaryModeS(Texture.CLAMP_TO_BORDER);
texture.setBoundaryColorS(new Color4f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f));
texture.setBoundaryModeT(Texture.CLAMP_TO_BORDER);
texture.setBoundaryColorT(new Color4f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,
```

> say again thing about texture mapping 
---
In Java3D, texture mapping is the process of applying images, or textures, to the surfaces of 3D objects. This can be used to add realism and visual interest to your 3D graphics and animations.

To use texture mapping in Java3D, you can do the following:

1. Load the texture image: You can use the BufferedImage class to load the texture image from a file or other source.
2. Create a texture object: You can use the Texture class to create a texture object from the image.
3. Set the texture wrapping mode: You can use the setBoundaryModeS and setBoundaryModeT methods to specify how the texture is repeated along the S and T dimensions.
4. Set the texture filtering mode: You can use the setMinFilter and setMagFilter methods to specify how the texture is displayed when it is scaled up or down.
5. Create an appearance object: You can use the TextureAppearance class to create an appearance object that applies the texture to a 3D object.
6. Apply the appearance to a 3D object: You can use the setAppearance method to apply the appearance object to a 3D object, such as a Box, Sphere, or Cylinder.

Here is an example of how to use texture mapping in Java3D:
```java
BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(new File("texture.jpg"));
Texture texture = new Texture(image);
TextureAppearance appearance = new TextureAppearance(texture);
Box box = new Box(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, appearance);
```
By following these steps, you can use texture mapping in Java3D to apply images to the surfaces of 3D objects and create more realistic and visually appealing 3D graphics and animations.

> say more about Flat shading
---
Flat shading is a type of shading that applies a single color to the entire surface of a 3D object. This can be used to create a simple and stylized look for your 3D graphics and animations.

In Java3D, you can use the FlatShadeAppearance class to create a flat shading appearance for your 3D objects. The FlatShadeAppearance class allows you to specify the material properties of the 3D object, such as the ambient color, diffuse color, specular color, and shininess.

Here is an example of how to use flat shading in Java3D:
```java
FlatShadeAppearance appearance = new FlatShadeAppearance();
appearance.setMaterial(new Material(new Color3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f), 64.0f));
Box box = new Box(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, appearance);
```
In this example, we create a FlatShadeAppearance object with a red material, and apply it to a Box object. The resulting 3D object will be rendered with a flat red color.

By using the FlatShadeAppearance class and setting the appropriate material properties, you can use flat shading in Java3D to create simple and stylized 3D graphics and animations.

Sphere sphere = new Sphere(0.5f, appearance);
```
In this example, we create a GouraudShadeAppearance object with a red material, and apply it to a Sphere object. The resulting 3D object will be rendered with a smooth and realistic red color, interpolated across the surface of the sphere.

By using the GouraudShadeAppearance class and setting the appropriate material properties, you can use Gouraud shading in Java3D to create more realistic and smooth 3D graphics and animations.

Phong shading is a type of shading that applies a different color to each vertex of a 3D object, and interpolates the colors across the surface of the object based on the surface normals. This can be used to create a more realistic and detailed look for your 3D graphics and animations.

In Java3D, you can use the PhongShadeAppearance class to create a Phong shading appearance for your 3D objects. The PhongShadeAppearance class allows you to specify the material properties of the 3D object, such as the ambient color, diffuse color, specular color, and shininess.

Here is an example of how to use Phong shading in Java3D:
```java
PhongShadeAppearance appearance = new PhongShadeAppearance();
appearance.setMaterial(new Material(new Color3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Color3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f), 64.0f));
Cylinder cylinder = new Cylinder(0.5f, 1.0f, appearance);
```
In this example, we create a PhongShadeAppearance object with a red material, and apply it to a Cylinder object. The resulting 3D object will be rendered with a smooth and realistic red color, interpolated across the surface of the cylinder based on the surface normals.

To continue learning about Phong shading in Java3D, here are some more examples:

5. Lights: You can use lights to control the appearance of your 3D objects when using Phong shading. Java3D provides a set of light classes, such as AmbientLight, DirectionalLight, and PointLight, that you can use to specify the lighting conditions in your 3D scene.
```java
AmbientLight light = new AmbientLight(new Color3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f));
light.setInfluencingBounds(bounds);
Group group = new Group();
group.addChild(light);
group.addChild(cylinder);
```
6. Normals: You can use normals to control the appearance of your 3D objects when using Phong shading. Normals are vectors that specify the direction that a surface is facing. Java3D provides a set of normal classes, such as NormalGenerator, that you can use to specify the normals for your 3D objects.
```java
NormalGenerator normalGenerator = new NormalGenerator();
normalGenerator.generateNormals(cylinder);
```
By using lights and normals in combination with Phong shading, you can create more realistic and detailed 3D graphics and animations in Java3D.

It seems like not going to finish it :( , but why is 5. and 6. ?  
Whatever, keep going to the next one.
> say more about Texture filters
---
Texture filters are used to control how textures are displayed on 3D objects. Texture filters can be used to improve the quality and performance of your 3D graphics and animations by applying different effects to your textures.

In Java3D, you can use the setMinFilter and setMagFilter methods of the Texture class to specify the texture filtering mode for your textures. Java3D provides a set of texture filter constants that you can use to specify different filtering modes, such as MIPMAP_LINEAR, LINEAR, and NEAREST.

Here are some examples of how to use texture filters in Java3D:

1. Mipmapping: Mipmapping is a technique that uses multiple versions of a texture, with different levels of detail, to improve the quality and performance of your 3D graphics and animations. You can use the MIPMAP_LINEAR constant as the texture filtering mode to enable mipmapping in Java3D.
```java
Texture texture = new Texture(image);
texture.setMinFilter(Texture.MIPMAP_LINEAR);
```
2. Anisotropic filtering: Anisotropic filtering is a technique that improves the quality of texture mapping when the texture is viewed at a steep angle. You can use the ANISOTROPIC_FILTERING constant as the texture filtering mode to enable anisotropic filtering in Java3D.
```java
Texture texture = new Texture(image);
texture.setMinFilter(Texture.ANISOTROPIC_FILTERING);
```
3. Trilinear filtering: Trilinear filtering is a technique that combines linear filtering with mipmapping to improve the quality of texture mapping. You can use the TRILINEAR_FILTERING constant as the texture filtering mode to enable trilinear filtering in Java3D.
```java
Texture texture = new Texture(image);
texture.setMinFilter(Texture.TRILINEAR_FILTERING);
```
By using texture filters in Java3D, you can improve the quality and performance of your 3D graphics and animations.

> say more about Wrapping modes
---
Wrapping modes are used to control how textures are repeated on 3D objects. Wrapping modes can be used to specify how textures are repeated along the S and T dimensions of a 3D object.

In Java3D, you can use the setBoundaryModeS and setBoundaryModeT methods of the Texture class to specify the wrapping mode for your textures. Java3D provides a set of wrapping mode constants that you can use to specify different wrapping modes, such as CLAMP_TO_EDGE, CLAMP_TO_BORDER, and REPEAT.

Here are some examples of how to use wrapping modes in Java3D:

1. Clamp to edge: The CLAMP_TO_EDGE constant specifies that the texture is clamped to the edge of the 3D object. This can be used to prevent the texture from repeating along the S and T dimensions.
```java
Texture texture = new Texture(image);
texture.setBoundaryModeS(Texture.CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
texture.setBoundaryModeT(Texture.CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
```
2. Clamp to border: The CLAMP_TO_BORDER constant specifies that the texture is clamped to a border color along the S and T dimensions. You can use the setBoundaryColorS and setBoundaryColorT methods to specify the border color.
```java
Texture texture = new Texture(image);
texture.setBoundaryModeS(Texture.CLAMP_TO_BORDER);
texture.setBoundaryColorS(new Color4f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f));
texture.setBoundaryModeT(Texture.CLAMP_TO_BORDER);
texture.setBoundaryColorT(new Color4f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f));
```
3. Repeat: The REPEAT constant specifies that the texture is repeated along the S and T dimensions. This can be used

To continue learning about wrapping modes in Java3D, here are some more examples:

4. Mirrored repeat: The MIRRORED_REPEAT constant specifies that the texture is repeated along the S and T dimensions in a mirrored pattern. This can be used to create a tiling effect with the texture.
```java
Texture texture = new Texture(image);
texture.setBoundaryModeS(Texture.MIRRORED_REPEAT);
texture.setBoundaryModeT(Texture.MIRRORED_REPEAT);
```
5. Modulate: The MODULATE constant specifies that the texture is modulated with the object's base color. This can be used to blend the texture with the base color of the 3D object.
```java
Texture texture = new Texture(image);
texture.setBoundaryModeS(Texture.MODULATE);
texture.setBoundaryModeT(Texture.MODULATE);
```
By using wrapping modes in Java3D, you can control how textures are repeated on 3D objects and create different visual effects with your textures.

Next, let's ask for number three :)
> say again about Repeat
---
In Java3D, the REPEAT constant is a wrapping mode that specifies that the texture is repeated along the S and T dimensions of a 3D object. This can be used to create a tiling effect with the texture.

Here is an example of how to use the REPEAT wrapping mode in Java3D:
```java
Texture texture = new Texture(image);
texture.setBoundaryModeS(Texture.REPEAT);
texture.setBoundaryModeT(Texture.REPEAT);
```
In this example, we set the wrapping mode for the S and T dimensions of the texture to REPEAT. This causes the texture to be repeated along the S and T dimensions of the 3D object.

By using the REPEAT wrapping mode in Java3D, you can create a tiling effect with your textures and add visual interest to your 3D graphics and animations.

nice, an end of shading, just keep doing :)
> say more about simple 3D shapes
---
In Java3D, you can use the simple 3D shape classes to create basic 3D shapes, such as boxes, spheres, and cylinders. These classes provide a convenient way to create 3D objects with a single method call.

Here are some examples of how to use the simple 3D shape classes in Java3D:

1. Box: The Box class allows you to create a box-shaped 3D object. You can specify the size of the box along the X, Y, and Z dimensions, as well as the appearance of the box.
```java
Box box = new Box(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, appearance);
```
2. Sphere: The Sphere class allows you to create a sphere-shaped 3D object. You can specify the radius of the sphere, as well as the appearance of the sphere.
```java
Sphere sphere = new Sphere(0.5f, appearance);
```
3. Cylinder: The Cylinder class allows you to create a cylinder-shaped 3D object. You can specify the radius and height of the cylinder, as well as the appearance of the cylinder.
```java
Cylinder cylinder = new Cylinder(0.5f, 1.0f, appearance);
```
By using the simple 3D shape classes in Java3D, you can easily create basic 3D shapes and add them to your 3D scenes.
