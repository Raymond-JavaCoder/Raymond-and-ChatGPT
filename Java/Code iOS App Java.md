> Can I code iOS app in Java? How?
---
Yes, it is possible to develop iOS apps using the Java programming language. One way to do this is by using a tool called RoboVM, which allows you to write native iOS apps in Java.

Here is a general outline of the steps you can follow to create an iOS app using Java:

1. Install the necessary software and tools, including RoboVM, the Java Development Kit (JDK), and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Set up your development environment by configuring your IDE and installing any necessary plugins or libraries.
3. Create a new project in your IDE and select the "iOS" option when prompted to choose a project type.
4. Write your app's code in Java, using the RoboVM API to access iOS-specific features and functionality.
5. Use the RoboVM compiler to translate your Java code into native iOS code.
6. Test your app on a physical iOS device or in the iOS simulator.
7. Submit your app to the App Store or distribute it through other means.

Keep in mind that developing iOS apps using Java can be somewhat more complex than using Apple's native tools, such as Xcode and the iOS SDK. However, for developers who are already familiar with Java and prefer to use it for app development, RoboVM can be a useful tool.

---
To export your iOS app to a physical device, you will need to follow these steps:
1. Connect your iOS device to your computer using a USB cable.
2. In IntelliJ IDEA, go to the "Run" menu and select "Edit Configurations."
3. In the "Run/Debug Configurations" window, click the "+" button and select "iOS Device."
4. Name the configuration and select your device from the "Device" dropdown menu.
5. Click "OK" to save the configuration.
6. To build and run your app on the device, select the iOS Device configuration from the dropdown menu in the toolbar and click the Run button.
7. If this is the first time you have run an app on your device, you may need to unlock your device and trust the computer in the device's settings.

Keep in mind that in order to run your app on a physical device, you will need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program. This program costs $99 per year and allows you to distribute your app through the App Store or through other distribution methods.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

> Can I share my app to my friends without being a member of apple developer program?
---
Yes, it is possible to share your iOS app with your friends without being a member of the Apple Developer Program. One way to do this is by using a service called TestFlight, which is a platform provided by Apple for distributing beta versions of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps to testers.

To share your app with your friends using TestFlight, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Upload your app to TestFlight by creating a new app in the App Store Connect portal and following the submission process.
2. Invite your friends to test the app by adding their email addresses to the testers list in the App Store Connect portal.
3. Your friends will receive an email with instructions on how to download and install the app using TestFlight.

Keep in mind that TestFlight is intended for testing purposes only, and is not a replacement for the App Store. If you want to distribute your app more widely, you will need to become a member of the Apple Developer Program and submit your app to the App Store.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

> I used to make my java game by rendering image to BufferStrategy of Canvas object, and add the Canvas object to a Jframe. Can I use the same way or a similar way to make my game in RoboVM?
---
In RoboVM, you can use the SpriteKit framework to create 2D games and render images to the screen. SpriteKit is a high-level, sprite-based framework that makes it easy to create 2D games and animations.

To use SpriteKit to render images to the screen in a RoboVM app, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Import the SpriteKit framework into your project by adding the following dependency to your build.gradle file:
```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "org.robovm:robovm-spritekit:$robovmVersion"
}
```
2. Create a new SpriteKit scene by subclassing the `SKScene` class and overriding the `didMoveToView` method:
```java
public class MyScene extends SKScene {
    @Override
    public void didMoveToView(SKView view) {
        super.didMoveToView(view);
        // Add your code here to initialize the scene
    }
}
```
3. To display an image on the screen, you can create a new `SKSpriteNode` object and add it to the scene:
```java
SKSpriteNode spriteNode = new SKSpriteNode("myimage.png");
addChild(spriteNode);
```
4. To display the scene on the screen, you will need to create a new `SKView` object and add it to your app's view hierarchy. You can do this in your app's `didFinishLaunching` method:
```java
public class MyAppDelegate extends UIApplicationDelegateAdapter {
    @Override
    public boolean didFinishLaunching(UIApplication application, UIApplicationLaunchOptions launchOptions) {
        ...
        SKView skView = new SKView(UIScreen.getMainScreen().getBounds());
        skView.presentScene(new MyScene());
        window.addSubview(skView);
        ...
    }
}
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

> but I usually build my projects with Maven
---
Yes, it is possible to build RoboVM projects using Maven. To do this, you will need to use the RoboVM Maven plugin, which allows you to build and deploy RoboVM projects from the command line using Maven.

To use the RoboVM Maven plugin, you will need to add the following plugin declaration to your project's pom.xml file:
```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.robovm</groupId>
      <artifactId>robovm-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>2.3.9</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>default-cli</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>ipa</goal>
          </goals>
          <configuration>
            <mainClass>com.example.MyApp</mainClass>
          </configuration>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```
To build your project, you can then run the following command:
```cmd
mvn package
```
This will build an IPA file (an iOS app package) that you can install on a physical device or submit to the App Store. You can also use the plugin to run your app in the iOS simulator or on a connected device, by using the `robovm:run` goal instead of the `robovm:ipa` goal.

> how about SpriteKit in Maven?
---
To use the SpriteKit framework in a Maven-based RoboVM project, you will need to include a dependency on the `robovm-spritekit` library in your project's pom.xml file. You can do this by adding the following dependency declaration:
```xml
<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.robovm</groupId>
    <artifactId>robovm-spritekit</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.9</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
Once you have added the dependency, you can use the SpriteKit framework in your code just like you would in a Gradle-based project.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

> Can you teach me more about coding with SpriteKit?
---
Sure! Here is a brief overview of how to use the SpriteKit framework to create a 2D game in a RoboVM app:

1. Create a new `SKScene` subclass and override the `didMoveToView` method to initialize your game:
```java
public class MyScene extends SKScene {
    @Override
    public void didMoveToView(SKView view) {
        super.didMoveToView(view);
        // Add your code here to initialize the scene
    }
}
```
2. To display an image on the screen, you can create a new `SKSpriteNode` object and add it to the scene:
```java
SKSpriteNode spriteNode = new SKSpriteNode("myimage.png");
addChild(spriteNode);
```
3. To update the game state and animate your sprites, you can override the `update` method of the `SKScene` class and use the `SKAction` class to create and run animations:
```java
@Override
public void update(double currentTime) {
    super.update(currentTime);
    // Update the game state
    spriteNode.runAction(SKAction.moveBy(10, 0, 1)); // Move the sprite 10 points to the right over 1 second
}
```
4. To handle user input, you can override the `touchesBegan` method of the `SKScene` class and use the `locationInNode` method to determine the touch location:
```java
@Override
public void touchesBegan(NSSet<UITouch> touches, UIEvent event) {
    super.touchesBegan(touches, event);
    UITouch touch = touches.anyObject();
    CGPoint touchLocation = touch.locationInNode(this);
    // Handle the touch event
}
```
That's a brief overview of how to use the SpriteKit framework to create a 2D game in a RoboVM app. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Sure! Here are a few more things you can do with the SpriteKit framework:

5. To add sound effects to your game, you can use the `SKAction` class to play audio files:
```java
SKAction playSoundAction = SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("mysound.wav", false);
spriteNode.runAction(playSoundAction);
```
6. To display text on the screen, you can use the `SKLabelNode` class:
```java
SKLabelNode labelNode = new SKLabelNode("Hello, World!");
addChild(labelNode);
```
7. To create physics-based games, you can use the `SKPhysicsBody` and `SKPhysicsWorld` classes to simulate physics interactions between objects:
```java
SKSpriteNode spriteNode = new SKSpriteNode("myimage.png");
spriteNode.setPhysicsBody(SKPhysicsBody.createCircle(20)); // Create a circular physics body with radius 20
addChild(spriteNode);

SKPhysicsWorld physicsWorld = getPhysicsWorld();
physicsWorld.setGravity(new CGVector(0, -9.8)); // Set the gravity to Earth's gravity
```

Sure! Here are a few more things you can do with the SpriteKit framework:
8. To create particle effects, such as fire, smoke, or explosions, you can use the `SKEmitterNode` class:
```java
SKEmitterNode emitterNode = new SKEmitterNode("MyParticle.sks");
addChild(emitterNode);
```
9. To create animations that involve multiple images, you can use sprite sheets and the `SKTexture` class:
```java
SKTextureAtlas textureAtlas = SKTextureAtlas.create("MySpriteSheet.atlas");
SKAction animateAction = SKAction.animateWithTextures(textureAtlas.getTextures(), 0.1);
SKAction repeatAction = SKAction.repeatActionForever(animateAction);
spriteNode.runAction(repeatAction);
```
10. To create games that use 3D graphics, you can use the SceneKit framework, which is built on top of SpriteKit and provides more advanced 3D rendering and animation capabilities:
```java
SCNView scnView = new SCNView();
SCNScene scene = SCNScene.create();
scnView.setScene(scene);

SCNNode node = new SCNNode();
node.setGeometry(SCNBox.create(10, 10, 10)); // Create a 3D cube with dimensions 10x10x10
scene.getRootNode().addChildNode(node);
```
That's a brief overview of some of the things you can do with the SpriteKit and SceneKit frameworks in a RoboVM app. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
